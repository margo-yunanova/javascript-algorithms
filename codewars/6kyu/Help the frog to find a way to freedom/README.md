You have an array of integers and have a frog at the first position

`[Frog, int, int, int, ..., int]``

The integer itself may tell you the length and the direction of the jump

```
For instance:
 2 = jump two indices to the right
-3 = jump three indices to the left
 0 = stay at the same position
```

Your objective is to find how many jumps are needed to jump out of the array.

Return -1 if Frog can't jump out of the array

```Example:
array = [1, 2, 1, 5];
jumps = 3  (1 -> 2 -> 5 -> <jump out>)
All tests for this Kata are randomly
```
