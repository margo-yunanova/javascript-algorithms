Positive integers have so many gorgeous features. Some of them could be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers.

## Consider an Example :

`10 , could be expressed as a sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 `.

## Task

***Given*** _Positive integer_, N , ***Return*** true if it could be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers , OtherWise return false.

## Notes

Guaranteed constraint: ***2 ≤ N ≤ (2^32) -1***.

## Input >> Output Examples:

```javascript
consecutiveDucks(9)  ==>  return (true)  //  9 , could be expressed as a sum of ( 2 + 3 + 4 ) or ( 4 + 5 )
consecutiveDucks(64)  ==>  return (false)
consecutiveDucks(42)  ==>  return (true) //  42 , could be expressed as a sum of ( 9 + 10 ++ 11 + 12 )
```
