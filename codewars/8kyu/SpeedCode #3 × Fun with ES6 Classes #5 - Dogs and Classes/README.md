Preloaded for you is a `class Dog`:

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name, age, gender, species, size, master, loyal) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.species = species;
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = size;
    this.master = master;
    this.loyal = loyal;
  }
}
```

You are then given a working `class Labrador` as your initial code.

```javascript
class Labrador {
  constructor(name, age, gender, master) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.species = "Labrador";
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = "Large";
    this.master = master;
    this.loyal = true;
  }
}
```

Shorten it so that it meets the strict character count requirements for this Kata.

Quick, get your timer out and get ready to time yourself. Are you ready? Ready, get set, GO!!! :D
